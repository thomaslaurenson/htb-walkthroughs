# trophy_room

Collection of my walk throughs, hints, notes, code snippets, tool logs, and resources for vulnerable CTF-style boxes.

## Intro

The boxes targeted in this repo are based off the **NetSecFocus Trophy Room** list by TJ Null, available as a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview). In addition, I am trying new boxes on Hack The Box when they are released (but they will not be uploaded until the machines are retired).
